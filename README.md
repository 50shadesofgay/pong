The basic idea is to use a simple *Pong* game to learn some HTML, CSS, ProcessingJS, and github pages.

---

## Step #1
From your own user account in github (i.e. you have logged into github), navigate to https://github.com/aaronr/pong and press the `fork` button in the upper right corner of the page.  This will `fork` the pong repository into your personal github account!

## Step #2
Since the default branch of the pong repository is for [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) you should now be able to navigate to your github pages URL and view the pong game:

`https://<username>.github.io/pong`

After you play the game for a few minutes to see some of the features it will be time to dive in!

## Read over the index.html file
Head back to your repository page for the pong game and click on the index.html link.  Inside of the html file you will see the basic structure for the layout of the page.  Note the css and Javascript includes, the in-line css, the body of the html, and the scoreboard and pong game sections within the body.

## Read over the pong.pde file
This file is a [proessingjs](http://processingjs.org/) file and contains the logic for the game.

## Exercise #1
Navigate to the index.html page and change the title of the page from `Aaron's Pong Game` to your own custom title!

## Exercise #2
Navigate to the index.html page and change the cover heading over the pong game from `My Pong Game` to your own custom heading!

## Exercise #3
Navigate to the pong.pde file and change the speed of the ball.  Make it faster and slower... play around with what happens with strange numbers.

## Exercise #4
Navigate to the pong.pde file and change the size of the ball.  Make it bigger and smaller... play around with what happens with strange numbers.

## Exercise #5
Navigate to the pong.pde file and change the color of the ball, paddle, and the background of the game board.

## Exercise #6
Navigate to the pong.pde and index.html files and add in the `Total Hits` a player has made since loading the page.  There is code already commented into the files... find them and uncomment them to get the element to appear (via the html file) and update (via the pde file)
